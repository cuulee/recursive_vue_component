# Recursive, Nested Collapse

> A short teaser on the power of recursive components in Vue.js

[Live stream of development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuNQ_lcm5VE)

I ran into some bumps here 'n' there with the video, and stated a few incorrect things [mostly about the data option](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#data).

Overall, it's a pretty short exercise into creating a very powerful recursive, nested component. I also through some cool stuff into the project, like dynamic/conditional styles. I love recursive components because of readability!

I would promise to go back and clean up the video, but... I probably won't.

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
