> A short teaser on the power of recursive components in Vue.js

[Live stream of development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuNQ_lcm5VE)

I ran into some bumps here n there, but overall it's a pretty short exercise into creating a very powerful recursive, nested component. Readability, yay!

I would promise to go back and clean up the video and code, but... I probably won't.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
